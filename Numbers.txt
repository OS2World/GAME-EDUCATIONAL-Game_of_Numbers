	Game of Numbers
	--------------

	programmed by R. Grothmann


The goal of this game is simply to combine six given numbers using +,-,* 
and / to produce a given result. Each number may only be used once. The 
computer can produce a solution, if you are helpless. You can also enter a 
problem of your own.

The program is running on OS/2 PM. It has online help in english or german 
language. To use the english version start "numbers.exe", and "zahlen.exe" 
for the german version.

The C++-source is included in a separate directory. It has been compiled 
with the Borland-C++ compiler.

Best wishes/2
